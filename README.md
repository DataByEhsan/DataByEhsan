# <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="30px"> Hi there, I'm Ehsan  

After several years of experience in the finance & investment industry,  
I realized that what excites me most is not just numbers on a balance sheet,  
but the stories hidden in data.  

So in 2025, I took a bold step: I began a self-learning journey in data analysis.  
This GitHub is my open notebook â€” a place where I document my projects, growth, and experiments as I transition into the world of data. ðŸš€  

I believe in learning by doing, and every repository here reflects a step in that journey.
